# MRN FOOTBALL LEGENDS

## Game Vision
MRN FOOTBALL LEGENDS is a manual, skill-based football game inspired by the visual quality and animation feel of eFootball, but designed as a single-player, offline AI experience. There is no PvP multiplayer, no autoplay, and no scripted outcomes. Every goal, save, and win must come from player input and decision-making.
